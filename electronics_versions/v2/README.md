# Electronics - Version 2 - MIDI-USB and MIDI-BLE

This is an improved version of Bach-o-mat's electronics and firmware,
which allows a **BLE-MIDI connection** to the automaton and adds a **display** and an **encoder** for an easier and PC-less calibration procedure.

We are testing it right now, it will be uploaded as soon as possible.
