# Hardware - Version Standard - 58-Key Modular Design

This is the **original mechanical version** of the Bach-o-mat, designed for **58-key pipe organ-style keyboards**.

---

## Key Features

- Supports **58 keys** (standard in 19th-century pipe organs)
- **Modular structure**: Separate modules for each octave of natural and accidental keys
- **Adjustable horizontal spacing** for compatibility with various key widths from ... mm to ... mm
- **Sliding support bars** for flexible placement across different instruments
- Designed for **FDM 3D printing** and **laser cutting**

##️ Assembly Overview

Each octave consists of:
- A **natural keys module** (white keys)
- An **accidental keys module** (black keys)

These modules can be **replicated and aligned** to form the full 58-key span.

The device rests on two **side support bars**, which:
- Slide to match the keyboard width
- Allow for **non-invasive mounting** (no screws or adhesives required)

The servos are housed in a base layer and press the keys from above using improved 3D printed mechanical arms.

## Fabrication Notes

- **3D printing** recommended in PLA or PETG with 0.2 mm layer height
- **Laser cutting** files compatible with 3 mm acrylic or MDF
- All parts are dimensioned in **millimeters**
