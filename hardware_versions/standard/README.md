## Key Features

- Supports **58 keys**
- **Modular structure**: Separate modules for each octave of natural and accidental keys
- **Adjustable horizontal spacing** for compatibility with various key widths from ... mm to ... mm
- **Sliding support bars** for flexible placement across different instruments
- Designed for **FDM 3D printing** and **laser cutting**

## Assembly Overview

Each octave consists of:
- A **natural keys module** (white keys)
- An **accidental keys module** (black keys)

For both natural keys and accidental keys modules there is a shorter model for the last octave which has only 10 notes.

These modules can be **replicated and aligned** to form the full 58-key span.

The device rests on two **side support bars**, which:
- Slide to match the keyboard width
- Allow for **non-invasive mounting** (no screws or adhesives required)

The servos are housed in a base layer and press the keys from above using improved 3D printed mechanical arms.

## Compatibility

Thanks to the adaptibility of its supports this version is intended for being carried in different places and used to play a wide range of disparate keyboard instruments.
